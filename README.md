# Docker
Hi there! Welcome! This is my Docker repository. I'll store my Docker infrastructure here in order to attempt to learn a thing or two.

# Setup
Currently I have Docker running on two hosts with the Windows OS (Windows 10). I am considering adding some Linux (Ubuntu?) based hosts. But that first requires some real world infrastructure in and around my house. :)

# Wiki
I will be adding some notes for myself to the wiki's.
